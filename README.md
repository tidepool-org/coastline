## Building

This is a [Golang](http://golang.org/) service and we are doing our own dependancy managment using the Comedeps file. To build as expected then run the command below

```
$ source ./build
```

See [runservers](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tools#runservers) for how to build and run a complete Tidepool working stack.
